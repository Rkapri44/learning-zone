# Exercise 04: CSS Box Model

Create a folder within the "css_exercise" directory named with your first name and the exercise number (e.g., "John-Exercise-1"). Within this folder, create an HTML file named "index.html" and a CSS file named "style.css". Then complete the following tasks:

1. Inside the HTML file, link the CSS file by adding the appropriate `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section.

2. Inside the `<body>` element of the HTML file, create a `<div>` with the class name "box".

3. Apply the following CSS styles to the "box" `<div>` using the CSS file:
   - Set the background color to light blue (#b3d9ff).
   - Set the width to 300 pixels.
   - Set the height to 200 pixels.
   - Set the padding to 20 pixels.
   - Set the margin to 40 pixels.
   - Add a border with a thickness of 2 pixels and a solid line style. Set the color to navy (#000080).

4. Open the HTML file in a web browser to view the box model layout. Make any necessary adjustments to the CSS rules in the CSS file to achieve the desired visual presentation.

5. Experiment with modifying the padding, margin, and border properties of the "box" `<div>` in the CSS file to observe how they affect the box model layout.

6. Inside the "box" `<div>`, create another `<div>` with the class name "content".

7. Apply the following CSS styles to the "content" `<div>` in the CSS file:
   - Set the background color to white.
   - Set the padding to 10 pixels.
   - Set the margin to 20 pixels.
   - Add a border with a thickness of 1 pixel, a dashed line style, and a color of gray (#808080).

8. Experiment with modifying the padding, margin, and border properties of the "content" `<div>` in the CSS file to observe how they affect the box model layout.

Once you've completed the tasks, save the HTML and CSS files.

Remember to validate your HTML and CSS code using online validators to ensure proper syntax and structure.

When you're ready to submit your exercise, commit and push the HTML and CSS files to the Git repository, including any associated files.
