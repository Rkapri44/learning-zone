# Exercise 2 - Using Colors In CSS

Create a folder within the "css_exercise" directory named with your first name and the exercise number (e.g., "John-Exercise-1"). Within this folder, create an HTML file named "index.html". Then complete the exercise.

## Applying CSS Styles

1. Inside the HTML file, create four `<div>` elements and give each one a unique class name. For example:

   ```html
   <div class="blue"></div>
   <div class="hsla"></div>
   <div class="rgba"></div>
   <div class="hex"></div>
   ```

2. Apply CSS styles to each of the HTML elements using internal CSS.
3. For the `<div>` elements, use different color formats for the background color:

   - Use the class name to select and style the first `<div>`.
   - Use the class name to select and style the second `<div>`.
   - Use the class name to select and style the third `<div>`.
   - Use the class name to select and style the fourth `<div>`.


4. For the `<h1>` elements, apply the same color formats to the text color as used for the corresponding `<div>` elements.

## Finalize Your Exercise

1. Save your HTML file.
2. Open your HTML file in a web browser to view the web page and check if the CSS styles are applied correctly to the HTML elements.
3. Make any necessary adjustments to the CSS rules to achieve the desired visual presentation.
4. Validate your HTML and CSS code using online validators to ensure they follow proper syntax and structure.

When you are ready to submit your exercise, commit and push the HTML file and any associated files to the Git repository.
