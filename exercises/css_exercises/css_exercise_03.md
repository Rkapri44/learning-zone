Create a folder within the "css_exercise" directory named with your first name and the exercise number (e.g., "John-Exercise-1"). Within this folder, create an HTML file named "index.html", and create a CSS file named "style.css". Then complete the exercise.

1. Inside the HTML file, link the CSS file by adding the appropriate `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section.

2. Inside the `<body>` element, create a `<div>` with the class name "text-container".

3. Apply the following CSS styles to the "text-container" `<div>`:
   - Set the background color to a light gray (#f1f1f1).
   - Set the padding to 20 pixels.
   - Set the maximum width to 500 pixels.
   - Center align the text horizontally.

4. Within the "text-container" `<div>`, create a `<h1>` heading with the text "Styling Text Exercise".

5. Apply the following CSS styles to the `<h1>` heading:
   - Set the font family to "Arial, sans-serif".
   - Set the font size to 32 pixels.
   - Set the font weight to bold.
   - Set the text color to a dark blue (#000080).
   - Add a bottom border with a thickness of 2 pixels and a color of gray (#808080).

6. Create a paragraph `<p>` below the heading with some sample text of your choice.

7. Apply the following CSS styles to the `<p>` element:
   - Set the font size to 18 pixels.
   - Set the line height to 1.5.
   - Set the text color to a dark gray (#333333).
   - Add a left margin of 20 pixels.

8. Create a `<h2>` subheading below the paragraph with the text "Text Decoration".

9. Apply the following CSS styles to the `<h2>` subheading:
   - Set the font size to 24 pixels.
   - Set the text color to a dark green (#006400).
   - Underline the text.
   - Add a right margin of 20 pixels.

10. Create a paragraph `<p>` below the subheading with some sample text.

11. Apply the following CSS styles to the second `<p>` element:
    - Set the text color to a dark red (#8B0000).
    - Add a line-through effect to the text.
    - Set the text alignment to justify.
    - Add a top margin of 10 pixels.

Once you've completed the tasks, open the HTML file in a web browser to view the styled text. Make any necessary adjustments to the CSS rules to achieve the desired visual presentation.

Remember to validate your HTML code using an online validator to ensure proper syntax and structure.

When you're ready to submit your exercise, commit and push the HTML file and any associated files to the Git repository.
