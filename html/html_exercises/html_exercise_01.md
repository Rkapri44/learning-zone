# Exercise 1 - Learning the HTML Structure

Create a folder within the "exercise" directory named with your first name and the exercise number (e.g. "John-Exercise-1"). Within this folder, create an HTML file named "index.html". In this HTML file, create the following HTML structure:

## Note - you'll see some tags that have not been covered like <code><header>, <nav>, <section> and <footer></code> . These are are semantic HTML elemnts
The Header element is used to define the header section of the webpage
The Nav element is used to define a section of a web page that contains navagation links. Usually located in the header
The section element groups related content and is a more speific alternative to a div
The Footer element is used to define a footer for a docement. It usually contains information such as copyright notices, links to related documents, and contact information.

1. Inside the HTML file, create a basic HTML structure using the appropriate tags, including the <html, <head>, and <body> tags.
2. Inside the <head> tag, add a <title> tag and give your page a title.
3. In the <body> tag, add a <header> tag and give it a heading that says "Welcome to my site".
4. Add a <nav> tag below the header and create a basic navigation menu with at least two links to other pages.
5. Below the navigation menu, add a <section> tag and create a heading that says "About Me".
6. Inside the section tag, add a <p> tag with a short paragraph about yourself.
7. Add another <section> tag and create a heading that says "My Skills".
8. Inside the section tag, add an unordered list (<ul>) with at least three skills you possess.
9. Add a <footer> tag at the bottom of the page with your name and the current year.
